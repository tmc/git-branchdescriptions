git-branchdescriptions
======================

This is a small tool to view and set git branch descriptions.

Usage
=====

When invoked without --set git-branchdescriptions shows the current local
branches with following descriptions. The -a, -v, and -r parameters control
which refs are shown.

Assuming git-branchdescriptions is on your PATH git will pick it up and it will
be accessible as git-branchdescriptions.

Tip: git config --global alias.bd branchdescriptions

git-branchdescriptions assumes current branch if branch is not provided.
Use --set to set the branch's description.

Example: git branchdescriptions --set This branch addresses issue foo.

    $ git-branchdescriptions --help
    Use --set to set the branch's description.
    Example: git branchdescriptions --set This branch addresses issue foo.

    Options:
      -v, --verbosity       Show sha1 and commit subject lines
      -r, --remotes         List remote branches
      -a, --all             List both local and remote branches
      -s, --set             Use to set the branch's description
      -b BRANCH, --branch=BRANCH
                            Which branch to operate on. Optional, assumes current
                            branch
      --no-color            Skip color formatting (for dumb terminals)
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
